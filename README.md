# Advent-of-Code-2024
AOC 2024 41/50 puzzles solved across C, C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, Rust, and Zig. Please forgive the mess as I used AOC2024 to try out many of these languages and ended up writing some silly code lol. Good luck! 

P.S. Let me know if you can figure out day 16 part 1.
